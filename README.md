## Inspiration


I have seen many developers who dislike writing code for their portfolios & if they like also but they struggle to keep their portfolios up to date. So I thought to Help them Build and Manage their Portfolio ** Free** and **Easly**
 
by the way, I'm also that type of person ðŸ˜‚


## Problem Statement

As I already told you My project will help users to build their portfolios in minutes & help them to manage them in seconds. many people struggle to build their portfolios and some struggle to manage them.

I came up with a solution for both types of people.

By using **Build Buddy** you will be able to create portfolios and manage them Easily Also you will get a unique URL for your Portfolio.

## How did I build It?

### Challenges I Faced

I was new to Database World. So, I faced some problems:

#### 1.  Creating Relations in the database

Firstly, was thinking that it's a huge task, I don't know how to create Relations, so would I be able to complete the app?

**But ** I was wrong it's Very Easy to create relations in PlanetScale!

##### **One to One:**

```
model User {
  id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  id     Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  user   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId Int  @unique // relation scalar field (used in the `@relation` attribute above)
}
```

##### **One to Many :**

```
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id       Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}
``` 
[One-to-many relations Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/one-to-many-relations)


#### In my case, I used these Two types of relations

### How does it work?

#### 4. Editing Content
